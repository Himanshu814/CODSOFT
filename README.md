**TASK 1: MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION**

In these task I created a machine learning model that can predict
the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual 
information. I have used techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings 
with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or
Support Vector Machines.

**TASK 2: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION**

Built a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Used a
dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and
experimented with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
and Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

**TASK 3: CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION**

Developed a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-
based service or business. Using historical customer data, including
features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and used
algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests and Gradient
Boosting to predict churn.
